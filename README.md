# Inventory Balancing
## Introduction
In this project, I use Python to coordinate inventory at stores within the system. By using historical sales data and current inventory data, I perform analysis and evaluation to ensure products are getting to the right stores where they are in demand, minimizing stockouts, and preventing overcrowding at stores with excessive inventory.
